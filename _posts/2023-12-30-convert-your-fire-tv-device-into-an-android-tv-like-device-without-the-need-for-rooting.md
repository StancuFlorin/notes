### Leanback Launcher for Fire TV

To begin, you’ll need to download a launcher that is similar to the one used on Android TV devices. You can find more information about it on [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/t/app-no-root-android-tv-leanback-launcher-for-fire-tv.3750451/) and download the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/tsynik/LeanbackLauncher/releases). As of now, the most recent version is 1.58.

### Launcher Manager

To proceed, you’ll need to download an app that can replace the default launcher of your Fire TV device with a custom launcher. The app also has a user-friendly settings menu since the default one is an extension of the default launcher and is no longer usable.

## The Instalation Process

Next, download the `Wireless File Manager` app from the default app store on your Fire TV device. The app is free to download. Once downloaded, start the app and select the `Start Wireless File Manager` option.

Finally, from your PC (or any other device that was used to download the desired apk), access the URL displayed on the Wireless File Manager app. In your case, the URL is `http://192.168.50.101:8080`. Please ensure that both devices are connected to the same network.
